# TryHackMe – Linux Fundamentals Part 1

## Overview
This room introduces the basics of the Linux operating system and command-line usage. It focuses on helping beginners understand how to interact with a Linux machine using the terminal and basic commands.

For a cybersecurity beginner, this room is important because Linux is the backbone of most servers, security tools, and attack environments. Without Linux basics, progressing in cybersecurity is impossible.

The room mainly focuses on Linux fundamentals, command-line usage, and filesystem navigation.

## What I Learned
- **What Linux is**  
  Learned what Linux is, where it is used, and why it is popular in servers and security environments.
- **Interacting with a Linux machine**  
  Learned how to access and use a Linux terminal through the browser.
- **Basic Linux commands**  
  Used commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, and `whoami` to understand directory structure and user context.
- **Filesystem navigation**  
  Learned how to move between directories and understand the Linux file hierarchy.
- **Working with files**  
  Learned how to create, read, and view files using basic commands.
- **Searching for files**  
  Learned how to locate files using command-line tools.
- **Shell operators**  
  Got introduced to operators that help combine commands and manage output.

## Tools & Commands Used
- Linux terminal (browser-based)
- Basic Linux commands (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, `find`)
- Shell operators

## Key Takeaways
- Linux is command-line driven and requires practice.
- The filesystem structure is different from Windows.
- Simple commands are powerful when combined.
- Terminal usage feels confusing initially but becomes clear with use.

## How This Helps My Cybersecurity Journey
This room builds the foundation for working in Linux environments used in cybersecurity labs, servers, and tools. It prepares me to use Linux-based security tools and understand system behavior during attacks and analysis.

This knowledge is required before moving into enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation topics.
