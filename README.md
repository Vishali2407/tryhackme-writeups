# TryHackMe Writeups

This repository contains my personal notes and write-ups from TryHackMe rooms that I complete while learning cybersecurity.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document what I learn in a simple and practical way
- Build strong fundamentals step by step
- Track my progress as a cybersecurity learner

Each folder represents one TryHackMe room.
