# TryHackMe Writeups

This repository contains my personal notes and write-ups from TryHackMe rooms that I complete while learning cybersecurity.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document what I learn in a simple and practical way
- Build strong fundamentals step by step
- Track my progress as a cybersecurity learner

## Why This Repository
I created this repository to:
- Reinforce concepts by writing them down
- Practice explaining technical topics clearly
- Build a public learning log that shows consistent effort

These notes are written from a student’s perspective and focus on understanding rather than copying official content.

## Disclaimer
- These write-ups are for learning purposes only
- Flags and sensitive details are not shared
- Content is written in my own words based on what I understood

## Next Goals
- Complete more web and networking rooms
- Learn basic web exploitation techniques
- Improve documentation and technical writing skills over time
